# Comparing SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks

This project explores and compares three popular machine learning models: **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Neural Networks**. These models are applied to a classification task, and their performances are evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project Overview
In this project, we compare the performance of different machine learning models for a classification task. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and the goal is to determine which model works best for the given dataset. By evaluating the models side by side, we gain insights into how each algorithm handles the data and its ability to make accurate predictions.

## Objectives
- Preprocess the dataset and prepare it for modeling.
- Train and evaluate three machine learning models: SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
- Compare the models based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Analyze the results and visualize the performance of each model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For programming the models and handling data.
- **Pandas/Numpy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating SVM and Logistic Regression models.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the Neural Network.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and model performance analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled data suitable for classification tasks. Each row represents an instance, with features that describe the instance and a label representing the target class. The dataset could be related to tasks such as binary classification or multi-class classification, depending on the data used.

You can use publicly available datasets from platforms like **Kaggle** or the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing the numerical features.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

2. **Modeling**:
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Train an SVM model with a linear or radial basis function (RBF) kernel for classification.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Train a Logistic Regression model to perform binary or multi-class classification.
   - **Neural Networks**: Build and train a Neural Network using Keras with fully connected layers and a softmax output layer.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate each model using metrics such as:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1-score**
   - Use **confusion matrices** and **ROC curves** (for binary classification) to analyze the performance of each model.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the performance of SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks using the evaluation metrics.
   - Visualize the results using bar plots, confusion matrices, and ROC curves to better understand how each model performs.
